# This class will be used to store the models information. Including their media, profile information, and other data.
# This is what will be passed to the scraper for downloading.
# For example, if big_jugs69 is a model then big_jugs69.messages.media will return a list of all media in the models messages.

# Eventually there will be a post frequency function that will return the average frequency of posts in days.
